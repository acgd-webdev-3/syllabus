      ## Merge (pull) requests

      *To get code from your working branch into the `master` you must request it.*

      - GitHub calls this a “Pull request”
      - It alerts teammates to new code
      - Provides a new screen for discussion

  - content: |
      ## Reviews

      *The goal of the merge request is to review code.*

      - Look at the code for typos
      - Confirm it works properly
      - Write a small review of the code

      **If you “Pull” in GitHub Desktop you can switch to the branch to try it out.**

  - content: |
      ## More commits

      *There could be changes that need to be made—that’s up to the original author.*

      - Make more commits onto the same branch
      - Get teammates to look at the changes

      ## Approval & merge

      *After everything is good, the merge is approved & copied to `master`*
