      ## Building pages

      **Here’s a preview of what we’ll be doing next week.**

      - Don’t copy your patterns’ code—include it.
      - Patternbot will populate a page by downloading and including the code for each pattern.
      - We can perform slight manipulations.
    notes: |
      This is just a quick, verbal, overview of the same material included in: [“Building pages with patterns”](/courses/web-dev-4/building-pages-with-patterns/).

      *It will hopefully help with understanding our ultimate goal of building the pages, not repeating ourselves, and guide major decisions when finalizing the pattern library this week.*
