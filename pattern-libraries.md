      ## Pattern libraries

      A common approach to designing websites

      - Break everything down into the smallest components
      - Write all the CSS individually
      - Combine the smaller components together into larger pieces

      *Create a library to showcase all the pieces together*

      ## Pattern library examples

      - [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/)
      - [MailChimp Pattern Library](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns)
      - [MapBox Styleguide](https://www.mapbox.com/base/)
      - [Walmart Styleguide](https://walmartlabs.github.io/web-style-guide/)

      ## Many individual files

      We’ll have **lots** of different HTML & CSS files

      - *Buttons:* `buttons.html`, `buttons.css`

      - *Cards:* `link-card.html`, `image-card.html`, `cards.css`

      - *etc.*

      ## Shared CSS

      Some CSS will be shared, but only the most basic stuff:

      - `modules.css`
      - `grid.css`
      - `type.css`
      - `theme.css`

      The `theme.css` will contain the common fonts, colours & basic typography & CSS variables

  - content: |
      ## Class everything!

      Unless you’re working in the `theme.css`—**do not target HTML elements**

      Absolutely everything will have a class on it—to avoid conflicts

      The `theme.css` is the only place you’ll target `<h1>` or `<dl>`, etc.

      ## Pattern library generator

      We don’t want to—and shouldn’t have to—write all the CSS to make the library display website

      It’s much better to use a tool to generate the page

      *We can then concentrate on making the patterns—not on making the layout*
