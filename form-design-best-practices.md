      ## What & why

      We all hate forms. Form design is difficult & requires a lot of attention to detail.

      There are lots of resources available for form design—it’s just difficult to figure out what practices are good & bad.

      **Let’s crowd-source the knowledge we need to make the best forms.**

      ## Set up

      1. Form into pairs
      2. [Download & print the bad form design](https://assets.learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/web-dev-4/form-design-best-practices-download.zip)
      3. Get out a pencil to markup the form
      4. Use your search-foo to find best practices for forms & error messages
      5. Write out on the paper how to improve the form
      6. We’ll discuss the results together

      ## Some considerations

      - Location of labels in relation to inputs
      - Size & clarity of buttons & fields
      - Colours
      - Language & text
      - Accessibility (screen readers, colour blindness)
      - Obviousness of errors
