      **Git with many**

  - content: |
      ## Distributed version control

      - Many copies of the code all over the world
      - Many people working together on the code
      - Let tools help us understand and combine our code
      - The less we do manually the less error prone things are

  - content: |
      ## Isolate new code

      - Make a copy of the primary code—called a branch
      - Do changes on the new branch
      - (Pull changes from the original branch into the new branch if necessary)
      - Send the new coded feature to GitHub for teammate review and approval

  - content: |
      ## Prevent overwrites

      - With branching we can help prevent code overwrites
      - GitHub will automatically merge when it can
      - GitHub will announce if there is a conflict in the code
      - GitHub is there to *help* us not hinder us

  - content: |
      ## Prevent stupid mistakes

      - Code reviews from teammates to find small mistakes
      - It’s the original author’s job to fix the problems
      - Can learn from reviewing—and being reviewed
