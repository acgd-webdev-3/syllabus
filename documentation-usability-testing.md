      ## What & why

      Everybody has a different brain & a different view—and everybody learns differently.

      We need to test our documentation, just like we test our apps, to confirm that the instructions work the way we expect.

      **Without proper documentation usability testing how do we know that the instructions work?**

      ## Set up

      1. Choose 2 complicated patterns, ideally patterns with patterns inside
      2. Make sure your pattern library is running on your computer
      3. Set up a dummy page in your website for testing: name it `doc-testing.html`; apply your `default` layout
      4. Open the `/doc-testing/` page in your browser

      ## Execution

      1. Ask 2 different people to come to your computer & add the patterns to the `doc-testing.html` page

      2. Observe their process and record any problems that arise—you can also ask the tester to verbalize their process
