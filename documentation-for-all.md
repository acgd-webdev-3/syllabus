      **Documentation for all**

  - content: |
      ## For your future self

      **Documentation should be written with the understanding that you’ll forget.**

      - Your future self will not have the same memorized head space of the code base
      - Make everything clear & understandable
      - If you did something weird: write a comment

  - content: |
      ## Document all possibilities

      **Every possibility should be fully explored.**

      - Document all the available classes for a pattern
      - Document all the editable fields for a pattern

      - *Document for yourself: are you going to remember all the classes you can use?*

  - content: |
      ## Examples, examples, examples

      **Give examples when there’s possibility of confusion.**

      - Our pattern library helps because it shows visible & code examples already

      - *Will you remember how to use each pattern properly?*

  - content: |
      ## Context is (yas) queen

      **It’s important that readers understand the purpose of the documentation.**

      - Provide enough details to explain when & why something should be used

      - Our pattern libraries already provide some context because they have a sole purpose

  - content: |
      ## Use consistent language

      **Stick to active and consistent language & verbs.**

      - “Choose this pattern for banners at the top of all product categories.”
      - “Never use this button style for forms.”
      - “Add the `.highlight` class only when the dinosaur is featured.”

      - *Very similar language to our commits.*

  - content: |
      ## The README

      **The readme is a good place to start documentation.**

      - Readmes help people get started
      - Use a readme to introduce concepts & contexts
      - The readme should act like a summary & table of contents
      - Use the readme to explain the installation process
